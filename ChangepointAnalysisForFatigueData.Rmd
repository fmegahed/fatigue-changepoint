```

In this paper, we attempt to examine whether the use of change-point analysis techniques is appropriate for detecting fatigue based on data captured from wearable sensors. As such, we perform a **secondary data analysis** to the data generated in: [Baghdadi et al., 2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00140139.2018.1442936). The reader should note that their raw data was preprocessed using:  

  (A) *Kalman Filter:* Used to process the raw data from sensors to: (i) estimate the spatial orientation of the body with respect to the global reference frame, and (ii) to estimate the kinematics of motion.  
  
  (B) *Segmentation:* The motion segments where then segmented using an algorithm that assumes the existence of two peaks in the translational acceleration of the gait cycle. This assumption was justified based on the results of [Tongen and Wunderlich, 2010](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/mathematics-and-sports/biomechanics-of-running-and-walking/0DC334F72A56527FC4517B297923E9D3) as well as the authors' preliminary analyses.  
  
The reader can **show** any code chunk by clicking on the *code* button. We chose to make the default for the code hidden since we: (a) wanted to improve the readability of this document; and (b) assumed that the readers will not be interested in reading every code chunk.

# Loading Data & Generating Features 

The snippet below documents the list of **R** libraries that were used in this research. For convenience, we used the pacman package since it allows for installing/loading the needed libraries in one step.

```{r, load_libraries, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rm(list = ls()) # clear global environment
graphics.off() # close all graphics
library(pacman) # needs to be installed first
p_load(R.matlab, plotly, extrafont, grDevices, gridExtra,
       dplyr, stringr, tidyverse, utils, reshape2,
       anomalize, forecast, MVN, fractal,
       ecp, dfphase1)
```

In the snippet below, we extract the 15 ".mat" files in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fmegahed/fatigue-changepoint/tree/master/Data/Raw) (where we loaded the data to allow for the reproduction of our work). Note that these files were originally produced in [Baghdadi et al., 2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139.2018.1442936?). Then, we perform several transformation steps: (a) extracting the data for the first three columns in the matlab arrays; and (b) computing three kinematic features from the data corresponding to these columns. Due to the differences between Matlab and R, this requires two nested *for* loops. The outer loop increments over the number of subjects, while the inner loop increments based on the different number of rows of data for each subject. Please see the comments within the code chunk for more details. 

```{r load_data, cache=TRUE}
num_subjects <- seq(1, 15)
subject_heights <- c(1.71, 1.77, 1.71, 1.59, 1.69,
                     1.63, 1.60, 1.71, 1.67, 1.78,
                     1.68, 1.55, 1.83, 1.81, 1.89)

  for (j in 1:num_rows) {

         )
  
  # Creating a Summary Data Frame

  summary_df[i, 1] <- paste0("subject", i)
  summary_df[i, 2] <- get(df_name) %>% nrow()
  summary_df[i, 3] <- get(df_name) %>% ncol()
  summary_df[i, 4] <- get(df_name)[, 2] %>% mean() %>% round(digits = 4)
  summary_df[i, 5] <- get(df_name)[, 2] %>% sd() %>% round(digits = 4)
  summary_df[i, 6] <- get(df_name)[, 3] %>% mean() %>% round(digits = 4)
  summary_df[i, 7] <- get(df_name)[, 3] %>% sd() %>% round(digits = 4)
  summary_df[i, 8] <- get(df_name)[, 4] %>% mean() %>% round(digits = 4)
  summary_df[i, 9] <- get(df_name)[, 4] %>% sd() %>% round(digits = 4)
}
# Printing the top six rows of Subject 4's data as an example
head(subject4_features) %>% round(digits = 3)

# A Summary of the features for all 15 participants
summary_df
rm(raw_data, raw_data_size, i, j, num_rows, 
   dataholder, num_subjects)
save.image(file = "./Data/RGenerated/FeatureGeneration.RData")
```

Based on the analysis above, there are **three observations** to be made. *First*, we scaled the stride length and height based on the subject's height. This in essence allows us to capture the steps as a percentage of the person's height. This reduces the between subject variablity in the data and is supported by the seminal work of [Oberg et al., 1993](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.473.947&rep=rep1&type=pdf). *Second*, we showed the first six rows from Subject 4 to provide the reader with some insights into the sampling frequeny (after the preprocessing done in [Baghdadi et al. 2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139.2018.1442936)). Note that the kinematic features are computed from the sensor channels provided in their paper. *Third*, we saved the generated data into an R.data file, which can be accessed by clicking on:  [FeatureGeneration.RData](https://github.com/fmegahed/fatigue-changepoint/blob/master/Data/RGenerated/FeatureGeneration.RData). We hope that this saved data allows other researchers to reproduce and/or build on our work.

# Detecting and Removing Outliers
In this task, we examined several approaches for *outlier detection*. We originally hypothesized that these outliers constitue faulty sensor readings (since they are not sustained), and thus, we can remove this data prior to any further analysis. **However, based on a detailed investigation of the data and the application of several outlier detection methods (univariate and multivariate), we have learned that the data is non-normal, highly autocorrelated and non-stationary. Thus, these approaches are not suitable for removing the outliers from our data.** Thus, we then investiaged the utilization of "filtering" based methods in Section 3 to impute/correct/smoothen the data. 

For the sake of reproducibility and completeness, we provide the results from our implementation of several outlier detection methods in the subsections below. *Note that these methods will not be incorporated in our final analysis.* They are presented here only to document how we reached our final model/approach. 

## Plotting the Data {.tabset .tabset-fade}
First, we use a standard line plot to depict the data for each feature by person. For the sake of facilitating the visualization process, we: (a) panel the plot such that the left, center and right panels correspond to the scaled stride length, scaled stride height and step duration, respectively; and (b) we save the results of each participant (P) in a different tab.
```{r LineGraph, cache=TRUE, fig.align='center', results='asis', out.width="65%"}

                         id.vars = "time.from.start",
                         measure.vars=c("scaled.stride.len",
                                        "scaled.stride.height",
                                        "stride.duration"
                                        )
                         )
  assign(paste0("p",i),
         ggplot(data = df_transformed,

## Implementation of Several Outlier Detection Methods

### Boxplots for Outlier Detection  {.tabset .tabset-fade}
One of the most commonly used approaches for univariate outliers are defined to be the observations that lie outside $\small 1.5 * IQR$, where the IQR is the inter quartile range. This can be easily implemented using in base **R** using the [boxplot.stats function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/grDevices/versions/3.5.1/topics/boxplot.stats). Below, we first provide the output and data plots for each person.

```{r BoxOutlierDetection, cache=TRUE, fig.align='center', results='asis', out.width='65%'}

# Filtering Approaches and Data Preprocessing Approaches
An alternative approach to detecting and then removing outliers is to use smoothing techniques to "correct" the data. Based on the results shown in the previous sections, the fundamental hypotheses behind this approach are: 
  
  (A) The sensors' data seem to be non-stationary, autocorrelated and somewhat complex (from a statistical perspective). More importantly, there are spikes in the data that cannot be explained by the kinematic model. These spikes produce values that are unrealistic (e.g., a scaled stride length > 1 is not possible since that means that the stride of the person is larger than their height). While this insight is useful, there is no hard limit that we can enforce since the literature reports mean values across the population instead of attempting to provide a physical threshold on what is possible.  
  
  (B) The outliers tended to appear in pairs of two; indicating a possible issue in the segmentation of the data. Note that we label this data as outliers since it is not sustained (i.e., it is unlikely to say that a person is fatigued for only two stride).  
  
  (C) Smoothing (i.e. a low pass filter on the data) will allow us to impute values for every stride (after an initial size window). This will allow us to preserve the successive nature of the strides, "fix" the outliers based on neighboring strides, and not throw away any observation.

## The Median Filtering Approach from the Signal Processing Literature {.tabset .tabset-fade}
An algorithmic approach based on these observations is implemented below. Note that we are using the [median filter](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470740156) from the [fractal package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fractal/fractal.pdf) on CRAN. Note that in the analysis below, we are applying the *median Filter*, with n=29 (i.e., the median is calculated based on a overlaping moving window of size 29 strides). We chose this window size based on the recommendation of our biomechanics expert as it allows us to: (a) ignore the effect of any turns in the direction of motion; and (b) the corresponding window size is approximately 30 seconds long (which presents an easy to remember rule for practical application).

# Multivariate Changepoint Detection
To be filled later.

## The Nonparameteric Approach of Matterson & James (ECP) 
In this section, we will examine the use of the approach of [Matteson and James (2014)](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2013.849605) for multiple change point analysis of our trivariate data. Our analysis takes advantage of their **R** package titled *ecp*, which is described in more details in the following paper: [James and Matteson (2014)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ecp/vignettes/ecp.pdf). The multivariate changepoint method will be first tested using the median filtered data and then using the CUSUM of the median filtered data.

### Using the Median Filtered Data {.tabset .tabset-fade}
To apply the *ecp approach of [Matteson and James (2014)](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2013.849605)* on the **median filtered data**, we need to use a window size (which reflects the smallest size of a shift that is to be detected). From a biomechanics perspective, we expect that the change of performance due to fatigue will be sustained at least for several minutes (until the person adapts and/or rests). Thus, the size of the window ($\small m_{ecp}$) should be $\small m_{ecp} \ge 60$. In our analysis, we tried the following window sizes: 60, 120, 180, 300, and 600. For most of the participants, the number and/or location of change were almost similar. For demonstration purpose, we use $\small m_{ecp} = 120$ below.

## The Approach of Capizzi and Masarotto (dbphase1)
To compare the performance of the ECP approach, we also investigated using the approach of [Cappizi and Masarotto (2016)](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00401706.2016.1272494) for another nonparameteric multivariate changepoint analysis method. Similar to the *ecp approach*, we applied their methodology on the: (a) median filtered data; and (b) cusums of the median filtered data. The results are shown in the following subsections. **Note that we did not perform the analysis on the differences since we concluded that it was less informative than (a) and (b) based on our conclusions from Section 4.1.** 

For the parameterization of the [Cappizi and Masarotto (2016)](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00401706.2016.1272494) approach, we used the default parameters of the [mphase1() function from the dphase1 package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dfphase1/dfphase1.pdf) with the exception of:  
  -- *isolated = FALSE* since we do not expect shifts to last only 120 strides.  
  -- *plot = FALSE* since we would like to use *ggplot package* instead of the default plot function.

Notes:  

  (A) Similar to the analysis in Section 4.1, we are using the window size of 120 ($\small m_{dphase1}=120$). This allows us to compare the results (in terms of the number of detected changepoints and whether these match better from a graphical perspective).  
  
  (B) Note that we have used the default $\small lmin=5$, which means that the mphase1 method will ignore any changepoints within 5 windows of the previously detected changepoint. While this is different than the ECP method, we still have more changepoints (and thus, we have elected against changing this default setting).

## Comments on the ECP and dfphase1 Methods
Based on the results in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, the approach of [Matterson and James (2016)](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2013.849605) is preferred since it:

  (A) Results in a more limited number of changepoints, highlighting more (practically) significant changes in the gait parameters. This result was somewhat surprising since we used the default settings for the approach of [Capizzi and Masarotto (2016)](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00401706.2016.1272494) throught the default [mphase1()](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dfphase1/dfphase1.pdf), which prevents having changepoints within 5 windows; and  
  
  (B) Is more computationally efficient. It had a shorter run time than the other approach.
  
In addition, from the analysis, the changepoints based on the CUSUM of the median filtered data are the most insightful. Specifically, one can discern how each participant's performance change as the experiment goes on. For example, P10 has a clear fatigued performance in the end, where the cusums of the stride length and stride height are decreasing rapidly after stride 5521.

# Comparing the ECP Changepoints with Participants' Subjective Ratings  {.tabset .tabset-fade}
Throughout the experiments, participants provided their subjective ratings every 10 minutes. The ratings were based on the [Borg 6-20 RPE scale](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139.2018.1442936). Recent literature on fatigue detection suggests that a rating of 13 can be used to estimate the onset of fatigue (see [Maman et al. (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687017300261) for a detailed analysis). The subjective ratings for each participant can be accessed at: [subjective-ratings-raw](https://github.com/fmegahed/fatigue-changepoint/tree/master/Data/Raw).

In this section, we perform the following tasks:  

(A) EDA, where we overlay the subjective ratings with the CUSUM changepoints;

(B) A threshold based comparison, where we use $\small RPE \ge 13$ to identify when a participant becomes fatigued and we compare that to the changepoints detected by the hybrid CUSUM-EPC approach; and 

(C) Utilize the [e.divisive() from the ecp package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ecp/vignettes/ecp.pdf) to obtain the changepoints for the Borg Ratings. Note that this function is the univariate approach for the multiple changepoint method examined in Section 4.1.
